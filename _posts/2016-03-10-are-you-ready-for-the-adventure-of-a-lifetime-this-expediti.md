Are you ready for the adventure of a lifetime? This expedition is going to be a little different than what you might expect because we are going on an inward safari! I'm Joel Casy and I'll be your host and guide on this incredible journey of self-discovery, self-realization and self-awareness! ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/513fd793a72b656e676933d70bdbef3a8e3260e1.jpg)

Why go on an inward safari? Plato's maxim "Know Thyself". Before plato Socarates said; The unexmanined life is not worth living!

Why is being self-aware important in ones' life? Until you master the subjective world, you will be a slave to learned patterns, behaviors, programming and conditioning(all unseen and unknown of course). It has been said; the day you control the movements of your attention in the subjective world, you are master of your fate!

So, if you're tired of bumping into life and feeling helpless, hopeless and victimized, the Inward Safari(tm) can be your way out!

I look forward to sharing this adventure with you!
