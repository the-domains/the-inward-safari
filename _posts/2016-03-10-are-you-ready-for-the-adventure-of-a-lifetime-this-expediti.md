This expedition is a little different because we're  going on an inward safari!

I'm Joel Casey and I'll be your host and guide on this incredible journey of self-discovery, self-realization, and self-awareness! 

Why go on an inward safari?

Socrates said "The unexamined life is not worth living!"

Plato's maxim "Know Thyself."

Why is self-examination and getting to know oneself important?

I have a sense that we are either living by default or we are living in conscious awareness. Being self-aware is living consciously. Until you master the subjective world, you will be a slave to learned patterns, behaviors, programming and conditioning. All unseen and unknown of course. 

You can't see what you can't see. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7df2929a-9281-4c40-8806-0a4cd184934c.png)

So, if you're tired of bumping into life and feeling helpless, hopeless, powerless and victimized, the Inward Safari(tm) can be your way out!
